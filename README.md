# Actor-Phonebook-Manager-2022

Simple shell script for managing an agenda of actors' phone numbers. First coding project.
This project is a command-line agenda that stores and manages the phone numbers of 50 popular Hollywood actors. The script offers several functionalities for viewing, searching, adding, and editing within the phonebook.

## Commands

#### 1. View Phonebook: 
Display the entire list of actors in alphabetical order.
#### 2. Search by Name: 
Search for an actor's phone number by entering their name, with case-insensitive recognition. If multiple actors share the same name, all will be listed.
#### 3. Add Phone Number: 
Add a phone number to the phonebook by selecting an actor without an existing number. The script uses reverse grep to filter actors without numbers.
#### 4. Edit Phone Number: 
Update an existing phone number by selecting an actor from the phonebook. The sed command is used to replace the old number with the new one.
#### 5. Easter Egg:
Identify actors whose phone numbers contain three consecutive identical digits through a fun, hidden feature implemented using a for loop.
